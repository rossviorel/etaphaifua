                            <p>We already knew the next game in the series - Sid Meier's Civilization: Beyond Earth - would support Linux at launch, but today's launch of Civilization V on Linux comes as a surprise.

I want to ask you an advice. Recently just out of curiosity I installed Ubuntu 16.10 and I am trying to play different games just to prove to myself that gaming on Linux is either dead or alive. So I have a weird bug with Civ 5 and would like to ask if it can be fixed. I have Nvidia GTX 770 and driver v. 375. The issue stays with highest settings and with medium settings. When I start the game all the textures (terrain, buildings, units) are very low quality

I wiped my Windows 10 and have been using Ubuntu MATE for the last few months. I've enjoyed it immensely, until today. The deal breaker for me is how unreliable gaming has been. I've played three games on Linux. Civilization IV which works almost perfectly through Wine and I'm quite happy with. Mount and Blade Warband, which has a native Linux app for it and yet, it crashes so frequently that it's unplayable for me and I can't get any support or find a solution through search engines I'm a newbie trying to get my games working on Linux. I'm using Ubuntu 18.04. I think I installed Wine can't quite remember, that or it came prebundled. I've found installing and running games to be remarkably easy. I honestly have no idea what I've been doing, but I still have been getting games to work. All I've been doing is clicking on the .exe files and remarkably they just work. I've even got .exe mod installations to work with only a little bit of tweaking needed. I see though As predicted by some recent steamdb changes, Sid Meier's Civilization V is finally available for Linux (via Steam), starting today. Hi, I was excited to see that Gathering Storm would release on day one for Linux. As the Windows version seemed to get some performance improvements I was excited to see if these would also hit the Linux version. Unfortunately that doesn't seem to be the case. I've run all benchmarks on both operating systems on the same hardware (i7 7700K; 1080Ti; 16GB RAM) before and after Gathering Storm hit. Here are the results: Before Gathering Storm Ubuntu 18.10 Linux (Graphics Driver 415.27) Windows.

One of the biggest economic problems today is inequality. As communists we don't necessarily propose high rich taxes but instead to give what made the rich rich and give it to the working class. Instead of taxing capitalists, just get rid of them altogether and give the surplus they extract BACK to the workers. The same argument goes for the minimum wage. I think the minimum wage is a bandaid for a bigger problem, which is that workers have no power over capitalists.

I've seen David bring this up multiple times to justify capitalism. People like him love to say that "Socialism kills innovation! Look at IBM, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google. Capitalism clearly creates the kind of incentive structure that leads to innovation!" What innovation is that? The reality is that computers and the internet came out of the state sector. By and large, what those companies did was tweak details and build upon the actually innovative state-funded and -developed technologi.
